## Introduction

Agentic AI represents a significant leap in how we interact with technology. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to implementing Agentic AI solutions using the DAPR framework and various cloud technologies. By integrating tools like OpenAI's SDK and Kubernetes, we can create intelligent applications that learn and adapt over time.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages a wide range of technologies:

- **Dapr**: A portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy to build microservices.
- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: A toolkit for developing intelligent agents.
- **Memory Management**: Techniques to store and retrieve information effectively.
- **MCP (Microservices Communication Protocol)**: A standard for communication between microservices.
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent Communication)**: Facilitates communication between different agents.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Structures for storing interconnected descriptions of entities.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Kubernetes**: An orchestration tool for managing containerized applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database system.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- **RabbitMQ**: A message broker that enables applications to communicate with each other.
- **Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform.
- **Rancher Desktop**: A tool for managing Kubernetes clusters on your desktop.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to set up your environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bilal0399/learn-agentic-ai.git
   cd learn-agentic-ai
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use Docker to set up your environment. Make sure you have Docker installed and running.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   After the dependencies are installed, you can run the application.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use Dapr's pub-sub model for seamless communication.
- **Scalability**: Deploy on Kubernetes for easy scaling.
- **Intelligent Agents**: Leverage OpenAI's SDK to create agents that learn and adapt.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Utilize Kafka and RabbitMQ for handling real-time data streams.
- **Persistent Storage**: Store data in PostgreSQL and Redis for fast access.

## Architecture

The architecture of this project is designed for modularity and scalability. Below is a high-level overview of how the components interact:

- **Client**: The user interface that interacts with the agents.
- **Dapr Sidecar**: Each service runs alongside a Dapr sidecar to handle service invocation and pub-sub messaging.
- **Agents**: Built using OpenAI's SDK, these agents perform tasks based on user input.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL stores persistent data, while Redis serves as a caching layer.

## How to Use

1. **Create an Agent**:
   To create a new agent, define its behavior in the `agents` directory. Use the OpenAI SDK to specify its functions.

2. **Configure Dapr**:
   Update the Dapr configuration files to include your new agent. This allows Dapr to route messages to the correct service.

3. **Deploy**:
   Use Kubernetes to deploy your agents. Ensure your configuration files are correctly set up.

4. **Monitor**:
   Use monitoring tools to keep track of your agents' performance. Adjust configurations as needed for optimal performance.
